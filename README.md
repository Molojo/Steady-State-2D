# Steady-State-2D
2D Steady-State and Transient Heat Conduction Simulation

Overview

This project implements numerical solutions for two-dimensional heat conduction problems using finite difference methods. It supports both steady-state and transient heat conduction in a rectangular domain.

Features

Steady-State Heat Conduction: Solves for temperature distribution using a sparse matrix approach.

Transient Heat Conduction: Uses the Crank-Nicolson method and Forward Euler method to compute temperature evolution over time.

Boundary Conditions: Fixed temperature conditions on domain boundaries.

Efficient Solvers: Utilizes sparse matrix representations for computational efficiency.

Visualization: Plots temperature distribution and centerline temperature evolution.
